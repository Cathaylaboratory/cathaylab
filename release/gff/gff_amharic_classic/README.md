## Technical Note

This package is identical to the `gff_amharic` keyboard where only the `.keyman-touch-layout` is different. 
The touch layout is the continuation of the QWERTY-based touch layout provided in the `gff_amharic` package prior to version 2.0.  The package is intended to provide the "classic" touch layout *only* and is *not* intended for use on non-touch environments. For a desktop version of the keyboard the `gff_amharic` package should be installed instead.
